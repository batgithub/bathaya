You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.![test](/uploads/test.jpg "test")test 3 somkdfj!dsêdjhgugjuguyguyg
